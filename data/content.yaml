Profile: Hi there! My name is Stan Wiggers, I am 25 years old and live in Deventer. I would describe myself as a calm go-getter who likes to look at things analytically. I am a sports enthusiast, I love hanging out with friends and every now and then I like to turn on my DJ Controller to mix music or turn on my PlayStation to play videogames.
